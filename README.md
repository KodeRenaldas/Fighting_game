# Fighting_game
A simple fighting game in Python
In the main menu you have two options, to start the game or quit
In the game you are fighting a monster 1 versus 1 combat
You have 100 health, while the monster gets a random amount of health
You have 3 ways to kill the monster, light attack, medium attack or heavy attack
You have the option to drink a potion to restore 50HP (monster gets to attack when you drink a potion)
The monster has a 50% to drop a health potion
There is no end-game, and the only goal in this game is to kill as many monsters, before you eventually get killed yourself
